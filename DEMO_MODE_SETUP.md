# ðŸŽ¯ Demo Mode Setup Guide for Presentations

## What is Demo Mode?
Demo Mode allows your app to work perfectly **without any server** - ideal for presentations where multiple judges will scan and login simultaneously. All authentication and data operations work locally.

## âœ… Prerequisites (All DONE!)

### 1. **Demo Mode Configuration** âœ…
- `DEMO_MODE: true` in `app/services/authService.ts`
- All auth functions support demo mode (login, register, logout, profile updates, stats)

### 2. **Demo Credentials** âœ…
- **Email**: `demo@sigmashield.com`
- **Password**: `any password works`
- **Or**: Any email + any password (both work)

### 3. **Demo User Data** âœ…
- Pre-configured with realistic stats:
  - 42 scans completed
  - 8 threats detected  
  - 3 reports submitted
  - 12 forum posts
- Profile with avatar, location, phone number
- All features work offline

## ðŸš€ How to Use During Presentation

### **For Judges/Users:**
1. Open your app
2. Login with ANY email and ANY password
3. Or register with ANY email and password
4. App works instantly without internet!

### **For Demonstrator:**
1. âœ… Demo mode is already enabled
2. âœ… All features work offline
3. âœ… Multiple users can login simultaneously
4. âœ… No server crashes or timeouts

## ðŸŽ¯ Presentation Flow

### **Option 1: Quick Demo** (Recommended)
```
"Please scan the QR code to access our app.
Login with any email and password - it's in demo mode for this presentation!"
```

### **Option 2: Specific Credentials**
```
"Use these demo credentials:
Email: demo@sigmashield.com
Password: demo123"
```

### **Option 3: Show Registration**
```
"You can also register with any email and password to test the registration flow!"
```

## ðŸ”„ Switching Back to Live Server

When you want to use the real server later:

1. **In `app/services/authService.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   DEMO_MODE: false, // Set to false for live server
   ```

2. **Start Django server:**
   ```bash
   ./Backend/start_production_server.sh
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits for Presentation

- âœ… **No Network Issues**: Works completely offline
- âœ… **No Server Crashes**: No Django server needed
- âœ… **Instant Performance**: No loading times
- âœ… **Multiple Users**: All judges can login simultaneously
- âœ… **Consistent Demo**: Same experience every time
- âœ… **Professional**: No technical difficulties during demo

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Demo data resets** when app is restarted
2. **Stats updates work** but are stored locally only
3. **Profile changes work** but are local only
4. **Always test** before presentation to ensure demo mode is working
